I haven&rsquo;t had nearly as much free time recently due to the feature creep of son 1.0

Time well spent however I haven&rsquo;t been spending much time doing which was my main goal for the year.  I&rsquo;ve kept up with the usual blogs and tech news ( and decided I should really find a way to make the crazy amount of cash required to purchase a Surface Book).
#Doing
For quite a while I&rsquo;ve been hoping to do some experiments/side projects exploring Akka.NET.  There was an interview with one of the creators on Hansel Minutes 472.  I don&rsquo;t have headphones for the train (the one reliable block of free time I have) so I&rsquo;ve been patiently waiting for the transcription to be made available.  Six months patient even.
Then fortuitously I managed to find a block of free time while at home.  Yes I could have listened to the mp3 version.  But instead what I did was think : How hard can it be to transcribe the audio myself so that next time there&rsquo;s an awesome podcast without a transcription I have some kind of solution.
And so was born: BingVoiceTranscription!
A jury-rigged system comprising of Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure Bing Speech Recognition and NAudio.  No GUI (or even console input yet), just a simple program using XUnit tests to execute/drive it.
NAudio is used to convert the mp3 -&gt; wav.  It&rsquo;s also used to split the wav data into 10 second chunks (the maximum allowed by Bing Voice).
The chunks of wav audio are then passed to the Bing webservice with the returned text being concatenated together." />

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of incredible some of the things that can be done in an hour or two of hacking these days.  The text isn&rsquo;t quite good enough so I may just need to listen to the podcast anyway but I&rsquo;m curious what a bit more effort could do.  A few things come to mind already:</p>
<ul>
<li>detecting silence before splitting the file in to chunks</li>
<li>using long pauses to create new paragraphs</li>
<li>trying to train/feed some hints to Bing voice recognition (especially if I know what the mp3 source is about)</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating transcripts from audio recently came up in a Xamarin application being developed at work so maybe I&rsquo;ll get to it sooner (and while on the clock).</p>
