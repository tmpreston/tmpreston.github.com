  <p>#Excuses<br />
I haven&rsquo;t had nearly as much free time recently due to the feature creep of son 1.0<br />
<img src="/assets/201511/01_SON10.png" alt="1i"></p>
<p>Time well spent however I haven&rsquo;t been spending much time <strong>doing</strong> which was my main goal for the year.  I&rsquo;ve kept up with the usual blogs and tech news ( and decided I should really find a way to make the crazy amount of cash required to purchase a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-au/devices/surface-book">Surface Book</a>).</p>
<p>#Doing<br />
For quite a while I&rsquo;ve been hoping to do some experiments/side projects exploring <a href="http://getakka.net/">Akka.NET</a>.  There was an interview with one of the creators on <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/472/inside-the-akkanet-open-source-project-and-the-actor-model-with-aaron-stannard">Hansel Minutes 472</a>.  I don&rsquo;t have headphones for the train (the one reliable block of free time I have) so I&rsquo;ve been patiently waiting for the transcription to be made available.  Six months patient even.</p>
<p>Then fortuitously I managed to find a block of free time while at home.  Yes I could have listened to the mp3 version.  But instead what I did was think : How hard can it be to transcribe the audio myself so that next time there&rsquo;s an awesome podcast without a transcription I have some kind of solution.</p>
<p>And so was born: <a href="https://github.com/tmpreston/BingVoiceTranscription">BingVoiceTranscription</a>!</p>
<p>A jury-rigged system comprising of <a href="https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/bing/speechrecognition">Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure Bing Speech Recognition</a> and <a href="https://naudio.codeplex.com/">NAudio</a>.  No GUI (or even console input yet), just a simple program using XUnit tests to execute/drive it.</p>
<p>NAudio is used to convert the mp3 -&gt; wav.  It&rsquo;s also used to split the wav data into 10 second chunks (the maximum allowed by Bing Voice).</p>
<p>The chunks of wav audio are then passed to the Bing webservice with the returned text being concatenated together.</p>
<p>The output is an impressive wall of text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey rock at a time for Ndc Oslos again June 15th through 19th in Oslo Norway Richard and I will be there of course.As well as all your favourite speakers world class stuff your folks in DC -oslo.com will see youthere.net rocks app.Srod 1134 with guest Erin Spattered recorded Friday April 10th 2015.Banner off Hey Richard Buddy are you doing I&rsquo;m you know hanging along here by the years gone by really fast am again.Into the crazy conferences and so on what a good conference season It&rsquo;s gonna be is not so many things happening at once I&rsquo;m judino I&rsquo;m gonna have to end of juggling shows around.Is there gonna be a legitimate answer to stop at things coming to play yeah Yeah yeah well How do I load ka go first it&rsquo;s crazy that&rsquo;s true well and some things we can talk about that?What&rsquo;s even crazier yeah Not that I feeling like now we&rsquo;re gonna start having shows in the can that I can&rsquo;t even put on the schedule until were allowed to talk about on out with come out.Just say it&rsquo;s gonna be a goodyearfor.net developers It&rsquo;s been so much fun Yeah Alright Alright man Let&rsquo;s roll The music for better know framework awesome dude.Are you Would you got Well I would looking for some good current articles amtda I found one?It isn&rsquo;t directly related to akka.net or even the actor model but you know a lot of um games are programs with the actor model it makes.Lot of sense chair yet and so I found a great series of articles on codeproject.com about Unity 3D ok.This from April 4th filter in her Yep 5 stars 62 votes and the average is 4.96.Is people love this article is from Vahe Karamian and I&rsquo;m sorry bye have fun miss pronounce your name but um because I&rsquo;m stupid like I from Connecticut.But seriously I this is a great article I started a reading it in your I didn&rsquo;t go to the walk through But if you go to tiny url.Dot com slash unity walkthrough What unity &hellip; (there&rsquo;s more but you get the idea).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of incredible some of the things that can be done in an hour or two of hacking these days.  The text isn&rsquo;t quite good enough so I may just need to listen to the podcast anyway but I&rsquo;m curious what a bit more effort could do.  A few things come to mind already:</p>
<ul>
<li>detecting silence before splitting the file in to chunks</li>
<li>using long pauses to create new paragraphs</li>
<li>trying to train/feed some hints to Bing voice recognition (especially if I know what the mp3 source is about)</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating transcripts from audio recently came up in a Xamarin application being developed at work so maybe I&rsquo;ll get to it sooner (and while on the clock).</p>
