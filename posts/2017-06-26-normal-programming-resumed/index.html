Normal programming&hellip;
Despite my best intentions I haven&rsquo;t posted recently.  What I did do was test the &lsquo;Reset this PC&rsquo; functionality built into windows 10.
I used to re-install windows as a matter of course every six months or so but haven&rsquo;t done so since free time became so limited.  I started
to have issues with my browser (and http traffic in general) where it would just stop working.  SSH and other TCP services were fine.
I removed anti-virus/firewalls and still nothing.
So the &lsquo;Reset this PC&rsquo; function in windows 10 works well.  What I didn&rsquo;t count on was the fact that I&rsquo;d installed/tweaked things for quite
a while getting Jekyll to play nice on windows.  In the end I decided to try the new Bash on Ubuntu (on Windows).  There still
ended up being a couple of quirks with Jekyll (even when following the most recent docs).
zlib required!
zlib is missing; necessary for building libxml2
Solved that error with : apt-get install zlib1g-dev
Version hell (just not the DLL kind)
I ended up with incompatible versions of the various libaries required to run/jekyll after attempting bundle update
The solution that worked for me was to follow the github-pages info here.  Which seemed like a good idea since it&rsquo;s hosted on
github-pages anyway.
After adding this to the Gemfile everything mostly worked:
source &#39;https://rubygems.org&#39;

require &#39;json&#39;
require &#39;open-uri&#39;
versions = JSON.parse(open(&#39;https://pages.github.com/versions.json&#39;).read)

<p>Dealing with these setup quirks kept me busy but since I understand next to no ruby/liquid if I run into other problems I may try something else<br />
to publish this.  There&rsquo;s a dotnet static site generator <a href="https://wyam.io/">Wyam</a> that may be slightly easier to rip apart and work with.</p>
<p>Jekyll has been interesting and allowed publishing for near zero cost but there seem to be a few ways of chaining together services like<br />
<a href="https://wyam.io/docs/deployment/appveyor">AppVeyour+Github</a> to do the same thing.</p>
