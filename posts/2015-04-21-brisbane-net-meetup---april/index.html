  <title>Brisbane .Net Meetup April 2015 - Learn by doing!</title>

  <meta name="description" content="This month&rsquo;s .Net  Meetup was all the new things to see in Visual Studio 2015 and ALM 2015 - Adam Cogan
The talk covered a brief walk down memory lane including screenshots of each of the versions of Visual Studio since 2002.  Quite amazing to see exactly how much has changed.  No real discussion on how stability has greatly improved but some highly amusing discussions regarding the dreaded ALL CAPS MENUS.
There was a brief look at the impressive App Insights which sadly doesn&rsquo;t have an easy binding for WinForms meaning it may be some time before I&rsquo;ll get to use it.
Great relaxed atmosphere as usual and while the talk pointed out a few things that aren&rsquo;t quite going to make it into the initial release we only covered half the topics.  I&rsquo;ll be looking forward to next month and ASP.Net &#43; .NET Core changes (provided son 1.0 doesn&rsquo;t require my supervision).
I&rsquo;ll also try and remember to thank Paul or someone from Octopus as the free pizza is a life saver after missing lunch.
