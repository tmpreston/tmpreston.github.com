Parsing Text: the Programming Superpower You Need at Your Fingertips
( Nicholas Blumhardt | [@nblumhardt][2]  |  )
After reading the Aggregate Queries in Seq series of blog posts I was definitely intrigued to see how deep this session would go into the Sprache library.  A great talk though there was only soo much that could be covered in the hour.

Introduction to Akka.Net
( Jaime | [@jaimefebres][5] )
This talk mainly covered quite introductory concepts for Akka.Net which I&rsquo;d already been exposed to after doing the bootcamp.  He did then provide an awesome demonstration of using Akka.Net as a facade around an existing service/component to ensure thread-safe access.  This wasn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;d thought of before and could definitely be of benefit with some legacy code at work.

Maybe if I get my act together I could put together/present a session myself for DDD Brisbane 0x6." />
