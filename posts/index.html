      <p>It&rsquo;s been a while (and another child) since my last post. The couple of times I went to post something I seemed to run into problems with running jekyll (previous blog site generator) on my local PC.
I&rsquo;ve been using Hugo / docdock at work for documentation generation and decided to make the switch on the blog as well. Haven&rsquo;t had …</p>

      <p>I recently had some issues trying to download a game Shadows Of War from the Microsoft Store. Despite a number of google searches including reddit threads, official forums etc, there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any recommended solution/s (Some places suggested re-installing windows but I wasn&rsquo;t quite up for that).
I tried looking into task …</p>

Normal programming&hellip; Despite my best intentions I haven&rsquo;t posted recently. What I did do was test the &lsquo;Reset this PC&rsquo; functionality built into windows 10.
I used to re-install windows as a matter of course every six months or so but haven&rsquo;t done so since free time became so limited. I started

      <p>Short post this time. I was reviewing the newsletter for Ocotopus Deploy and came across an article on automatically restarting Octopus Tentacle services.
I liked the idea but as part of my automate all the things preference at the moment I thought it should be possible to do this without getting an GUI involved. Fortunately this is easily …</p>

It&rsquo;s been an interesting year at work. I&rsquo;ve been hard at work on creating a cloud based offering of our application. This wasn&rsquo;t something on the roadmap as the application was a thick client built on .NET in WinForms. Recently cloud providers have been trying to ensure that they&rsquo;re able to migrate any and all software and …</p>

      <p>Another year another DDD. The 2015 event was great and lives up to the by developers for developers mantra. This year was just as relaxed and amusing as last year. Two sessions stood for me and I suspect I&rsquo;ll investigate a bit further:

I haven&rsquo;t had nearly as much free time recently due to the feature creep of son 1.0
Time well spent however I haven&rsquo;t been spending much time doing which was my main goal for the year. I&rsquo;ve kept up with the usual blogs and tech news ( and decided I should really find a way to make the crazy amount of cash required to …</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/2015-06-30-vps-hosting/">VPS Hosting</a></h2>
      <p>Before hosting here on the awesome GitHub Pages, I contemplated setting up a VPS server. One of my first choices, Digital Ocean recently sent me an offer for a free T-shirt if I set up a droplet and answered some survey questions.
I haven&rsquo;t gotten a free T-shirt since my initial take on Xamarin, so I decided to see how hard it would be to …</p>

The start Exciting times at the moment with the release of the RC for Visual Studio 2015 Community (&amp; Enterprise Editions). Since I&rsquo;m normally technically curious I thought I&rsquo;d download and have a look. Obviously the first step I took was to run

The talk covered a brief walk down memory lane including screenshots of each of the versions of Visual Studio since 2002. Quite amazing to see exactly how much has changed. No real discussion on how stability has greatly improved but some …</p>

      <p>So in my ongoing quest to become a better developer I&rsquo;ve decided I should be reading less and doing more. Reading blogs has helped improved both my code and general development practices but ultimately I&rsquo;m going to learn more by trying things out for myself.
In the past my participation in side projects could be easily …</p>
