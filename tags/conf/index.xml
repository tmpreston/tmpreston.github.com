      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another year another &lt;a href=&#34;http://dddbrisbane.com/&#34;&gt;DDD&lt;/a&gt;.  The 2015 event was great and lives up to the &lt;em&gt;by developers for developers&lt;/em&gt; mantra.  This year was just as relaxed and amusing as last year.  Two sessions stood for me and I suspect I&amp;rsquo;ll investigate a bit further:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr/&gt;&#xA;Parsing Text: the Programming Superpower You Need at Your Fingertips&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;( Nicholas Blumhardt | [@nblumhardt][2]  | &lt;http://nblumhardt.com&gt; )&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After reading the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nblumhardt.com/2015/11/aggregate-queries-in-seq-part-1-goals/&#34;&gt;Aggregate Queries in Seq&lt;/a&gt; series of blog posts I was definitely intrigued to see how deep this session would go into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sprache/Sprache&#34;&gt;Sprache&lt;/a&gt; library.  A great talk though there was only soo much that could be covered in the hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr/&gt;&#xA;Introduction to Akka.Net&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;( Jaime | [@jaimefebres][5] )&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This talk mainly covered quite introductory concepts for Akka.Net which I&amp;rsquo;d already been exposed to after doing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/petabridge/akka-bootcamp&#34;&gt;bootcamp&lt;/a&gt;.  He did then provide an awesome demonstration of using Akka.Net as a facade around an existing service/component to ensure thread-safe access.  This wasn&amp;rsquo;t something I&amp;rsquo;d thought of before and could definitely be of benefit with some legacy code at work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr/&gt;&#xA;Maybe if I get my act together I could put together/present a session myself for DDD Brisbane 0x6.</description>
