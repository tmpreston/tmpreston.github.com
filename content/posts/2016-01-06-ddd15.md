Another year another [DDD][1].  The 2015 event was great and lives up to the *by developers for developers* mantra.  This year was just as relaxed and amusing as last year.  Two sessions stood for me and I suspect I'll investigate a bit further:
<hr/>
Parsing Text: the Programming Superpower You Need at Your Fingertips<br/>
( Nicholas Blumhardt | [@nblumhardt][2]  | <http://nblumhardt.com> )

After reading the [Aggregate Queries in Seq][3] series of blog posts I was definitely intrigued to see how deep this session would go into the [Sprache][4] library.  A great talk though there was only soo much that could be covered in the hour.
<hr/>
Introduction to Akka.Net<br/>
( Jaime | [@jaimefebres][5] )

This talk mainly covered quite introductory concepts for Akka.Net which I'd already been exposed to after doing the [bootcamp][6].  He did then provide an awesome demonstration of using Akka.Net as a facade around an existing service/component to ensure thread-safe access.  This wasn't something I'd thought of before and could definitely be of benefit with some legacy code at work.

Maybe if I get my act together I could put together/present a session myself for DDD Brisbane 0x6.
