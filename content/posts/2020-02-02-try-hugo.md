It's been a while (and another child) since my last post.  The couple of times I went to post something I seemed to run into problems with running jekyll (previous blog site generator) on my local PC.

I've been using [Hugo][1] / [docdock][2] at work for documentation generation and decided to make the switch on the blog as well.  Haven't had anywhere near the same number of issues/quirks and installation just requires a single binary (or choco install hugo-extended in reality).
